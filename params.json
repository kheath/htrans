They take a file with blocks of genes (.afa) and convert it to\r\nfasta format.\r\n\r\n### fasta2phylip.sh  \r\n\r\nThis is a shell script that converts fasta files to phylip format.\r\n\r\n\r\n### mrca.py\r\n\r\nmrca(tree, family) returns the most recent common ancestor for a given gene family.\r\n\r\n### testATree\r\n\r\nThe correct phylogenetic tree for our 5 sample species.  I typed this out by hand, there was no script directly involved in making this.\r\n\r\n### processFamGenes.py\r\n\r\nThis is a collection of scripts put together to generate the needed information\r\nto run dupDel.  It's a good idea to run this once and keep the files around.\r\nIt is important to note that the input files are made once with other scripts I\r\nhaven't looked into.\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n+ fam.out (silix results)\r\n+ geneSpeciesMap.txt\r\n+ dbList.txt (file with sample species)\r\n+ geneOrder.txt \r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n+ famGenes.txt\r\n+ famInfoResult.txt\r\n+ adjacencyInfo.txt\r\n\r\nSample command: python processFamGenes.py -f fam.out -m geneSpeciesMap.txt -d dbList.txt -g geneOrder.txt\r\n\r\n### dupDel.py\r\n\r\nThis script calculates the minimum cost and associated duplications/deletions for every gene family.\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n+ testATree\r\n+ famInfoResult.txt\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n+ dupDelAll.txt\r\n\r\nSample command: python dupDel.py -t testATree -f famInfoResult.txt -d 3 -c 5 -n 1\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors & Contributors\r\n\r\nJohn Snow knows nothing.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nFor additional help, pray to Cthulhu\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
