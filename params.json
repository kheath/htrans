{"name":"Htrans","tagline":"Horizontal Gene Transfer project","body":"# Horizontal Gene Transfer project\r\n## Collaborative project for Eliot Bush\r\n\r\n## Goals:  \r\n+ Partially reconstruct gene family lineages in Escherichia Coli\r\n+ Identify horizontal gene transfer events\r\n\r\n### superalignv2.py & phylibalign.py  \r\n\r\nThese two python scripts are very similar.  They take a file with blocks of genes (.afa) and convert it to fasta format.\r\n\r\n### fasta2phylip.sh  \r\n\r\nThis is a shell script that converts fasta files to phylip format.\r\n\r\n\r\n### mrca\r\n\r\nmrca(tree, family) returns the most recent common ancestor for a given gene family.\r\n\r\n### testATree\r\n\r\nThe correct phylogenetic tree for our 5 sample species.  I typed this out by hand based on a tree generated by RAxML, there was no script directly involved in making this.\r\n\r\n### processFamGenes\r\n\r\nThis is a collection of scripts put together to generate the needed information\r\nto run dupDel.  It's a good idea to run this once and keep the files around.\r\nIt is important to note that the input files are made once with other scripts I\r\nhaven't looked into.\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n+ fam.out (silix results)\r\n+ geneSpeciesMap.txt\r\n+ dbList.txt (file with sample species)\r\n+ geneOrder.txt \r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n+ famGenes.txt\r\n+ famInfoResult.txt\r\n+ adjacencyInfo.txt\r\n\r\nSample command: python processFamGenes.py -f fam.out -m geneSpeciesMap.txt -d dbList.txt -g geneOrder.txt\r\n\r\n### dupDel\r\n\r\nThis script calculates the minimum cost and associated duplications/deletions for every gene family.\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n+ testATree\r\n+ famInfoResult.txt\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n+ dupDelAll.txt\r\n\r\nSample command: python dupDel.py -t testATree -f famInfoResult.txt -d 3 -c 5 -n 1\r\n\r\n### htrans.py\r\n\r\nThis is a wrapper for the main pipeline.  Make sure you've done all the preprocessing steps before running this (Preprocessing not included in this repository).\r\n\r\nExample: python htrans.py -f siLiX_families -m gene<->species_map -d list_of_species_of_interest -g gene_order -t phylogenetic_tree -b deletion_cost -c duplication_cost -s #_of_species -o full_species_list\r\n\r\n### Authors & Contributors\r\n\r\nKevin Heath & Zunyan Wang\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nEmail me at kevin.n.heath@gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
